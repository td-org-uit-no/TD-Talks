# Abstract

Compilers are essential to the world of software engineering. They play a vital role in transforming high-level code into machine-readable instructions, ensuring efficient, effective, and optimized software programs. In this introductory technical talk, we will explore the basics of compilers and provide a simple understanding of how they work through examples from a domain specific language. At the end of the talk, attendees will understand the importance of compilers and appreciate the crucial role they play in the creation of effective and efficient software programs. This talk is ideal for anyone curious about compilers, or just starting to learn about software development. Whether you are a software engineer, scientist, or student, this talk will provide a solid foundation for further learning and exploration of this critical aspect of software engineering.

## Short Bio

**Lisa Jonsson** is originally from Sweden but moved to Norway last year. She is a Software Engineer at Microsoft, with a Masters in Computer science from Lule√• University of Technology with a focus on algorithms, distributed systems and machine learning.

**Anders Gjerdrum** is a Senior Software Engineer at Microsoft and Associate Professor II at UiT: The Arctic University of Norway.

Together, they are part of a team in charge of developing an in-house built compiler stack for graph query evaluation on planet-scale geo-distributed databases.
